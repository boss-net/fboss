/**
 * CPU connects to first set of FPGAs through the PCI bus. In some multiple card
 * platform like Minipack, there are another set of FPGAs connecting to the
 * first set through internal bus and communication protocol.
 *
 * No matter how the FPGA is connected to the CPU, SW uses the same way to
 * access the FPGA function. That is to access FPGA memory through a virtual
 * memory address.
 *
 * How to map FPGA physical memory into virtual memory is different, depending
 * on how FPGA is connected to the CPU. For the FPGA directly connected to the
 * CPU, we retrieve the physical memory address and its size through BAR
 * register of such device. mmap() that physical memory into the process
 * virtual memory space. For the FPGA indirectly connected to the CPU, their
 * memory space is represented as a region within the FPGA memory space
 * directly connected to the CPU.
 *
 * FpgaDevice models how we see a FPGA device on the PCI bus.
